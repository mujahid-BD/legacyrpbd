      <h2>About the community</h2>
      <p><strong>Another "subdivision" of Legacy Roleplay: Bangladesh</strong></p>
      <p>Legacy Roleplay is an English community founded in early 2018. We have been asked to create a subdivision, aimed at players from Bangladesh. As we are open and intrigued by the new possibilities and opportunities.</p>
      <p>This "subdivision" of Legacy is owned by the main community, but is fully managed and controlled by others.</p>
      <p>We hope this allows for a better and more enjoyable experience for the Bengali part of our community, and provides a better environment for role play and growth.</p>
      <p>FiveM servers are still hosted by the main community. This discord is also owned by the main community, but is controlled by another person.</p>
      <p><em>The FiveM server database is not synchronized between the main server and this division.</em></p>
